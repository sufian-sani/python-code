Help!
Maybe you already know the name of a Python Learn function, but you still have to figure out how to use it. Ironically, you have to ask for information about a function with another function: help(). In IPython specifically, you can also use ? before the function name.

To get help on the max() function, for example, you can use one of these calls:

help(max)
?max
Use the Shell to open up the documentation on complex(). Which of the following statements is true?

# help(max)
help(complex)

The decimal system is base 10 (ten symbols, 0-9, are used to represent a number) and similarly, binary is base 2, octal is base 8 and hexadecimal is base 16.

A number with the prefix 0b is considered binary, 0o is considered octal and 0x as hexadecimal. For example:

60 = 0b11100 = 0o74 = 0x3c

Source Code:
# Python program to convert decimal into other number systems
dec = 344

print("The decimal value of", dec, "is:")
print(bin(dec), "in binary.")
print(oct(dec), "in octal.")
print(hex(dec), "in hexadecimal.")

Output:

The decimal value of 344 is:
0b101011000 in binary.
0o530 in octal.
0x158 in hexadecimal.
